Determination of the pharmaceutical treatment-dosage for cancer patients using non-linear optimization techniques. 
Simulating the optimal dosage of single-drug chemotherapy, using modern computational methods, mathematical data analysis and algorithms (MATLAB).

Define optimal drug dosage by applying:

the Hermite-Simpson Direct Collocation (DIRCOL) method :
